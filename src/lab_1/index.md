🐝 Pollinator Activity Dashboard
Data Context

This dashboard analyzes June 2024 field observations from a local farm to understand bee behavior, flower nectar yield, and weather impacts on pollination.

1️⃣ Body Mass and Wing Span Distribution
<div id="mass_wingspan"></div>

Insight:
Honeybees are smallest (≈0.10 g, 19 mm wingspan), Bumblebees are mid-sized (≈0.25 g, 35 mm), and Carpenter Bees are largest (≈0.45 g, 42 mm).

2️⃣ Ideal Weather Conditions for Pollination
<div id="weather_trends"></div>

Insight:
Pollinators are most active around 28 °C, under Cloudy conditions, and with 60–70% humidity.

3️⃣ Nectar Production by Flower Species
<div id="nectar_chart"></div>

Insight:
🌻 Sunflowers have the highest nectar yield (≈0.94 μL), followed by Coneflowers (≈0.64 μL) and Lavender (≈0.54 μL).
